This course introduces the fundamental principles of probability theory and statistical analysis that form the mathematical backbone of modern Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Students learn how to model uncertainty, analyze data, and make informed decisions based on probabilistic reasoning.

Through hands-on examples and AI-driven applications, the course bridges theory with practice â€” covering topics such as random variables, distributions, estimation, hypothesis testing, regression, Bayesian inference, and statistical learning. Emphasis is placed on applying these techniques to real-world datasets, developing an intuition for uncertainty, and understanding how statistical reasoning underpins algorithms in computer vision, natural language processing, and predictive modeling.

Key Topics:
- Fundamentals of Probability Theory
- Random Variables and Probability Distributions
- Expectation, Variance, and Covariance
- Sampling and Estimation Techniques
- Hypothesis Testing and Confidence Intervals 
- Correlation and Regression Analysis
- Bayesian Statistics and Inference
- Statistical Decision Making
